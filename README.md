# Library Management System - Back End <img src="assets/library.png" alt="drawing" width="27px"/>

This project was initially developed as a **monolithic design**, and then 
the **n-tier architecture** was applied to the project in order to understand and improve knowledge of software architectures. 
**Seventeen web services** are exposed as APIs under the **members**, **books**, **issue-notes** and **returns** resources in this project.

More information on the exposed web services with example test cases can be found in the 
API documentations listed below.
- [**Members API documentation**](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/25306703/2s8ZDa224j)
- [**Books API documentation**](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/25306703/2s8ZDa229D)
- [**Issue-Notes API documentation**](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/25306703/2s8ZDa2M6F)
- [**Returns API documentation**](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/25306703/2s8ZDa2MEy)


#### Highlighted features of the application,
- Members are registered to the system by [**UUID**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier), and no two members can have the same contact number.
- Books are registered to the system by international standard book number (isbn).
- When members take books from the library they will receive an issue note.
- The issue note contains all the take away book ISBNs along with the member UUID.
- All issue notes have unique issue id to uniquely identify them when the books are returned.
- Issue note can only have maximum 3 distinct ISBNs.
- A member cannot take the same book from the system twice at the same time or at two different times (with another issue note).
- A member can only take maximum of 3 different books from the system. If he/she needs another, he/she must return a book that he/she already got.

The project was tested in test directory using **h2** in-memory RDBMS.
